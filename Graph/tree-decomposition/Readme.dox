/// \defgroup tree-decomposition Tree-decomposition
/// \brief This module contains all the classes which allow to manage decompositions.
/// \details It includes notably:
/// - tree-decomposition computed thanks to heuristics (like the H-TD framework)
/// - tree-decomposition computed thanks to a triangulation (like Min-Fill)
/// - exact tree-decomposition computed thanks to the tools provided for PACE'17
/// - heuristics for computing the first cluster (for the H-TD framework)
/// - heuristics for choosing the root cluster
/// - heuristics for choosing the next cluster
