TODO List:
- implement the function Load_CSP in the Graph class
- implement the function Load_WCSP in the Graph class
- take into account the connected components when triangulating a graph with several connected components
- add the notion of subgraph and partial subgraph (useful in order to take into account the several components and cutset respectively)
- fix the problem during the checking of parameters in convert tool


- possible pb when copying a graph (the graph is not free before assigning with a new value) in classes Graph or Light_Graph
